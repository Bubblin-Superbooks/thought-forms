<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">the self-sacrificing love which pours itself out in joyous service, never once thinking of result or return; his thought has been, not "How much can I give?" but "How much can I gain?" and so it has expressed itself in these re-entering curves. It has not even ventured to throw itself boldly outward, as do other thoughts, but projects half-heartedly from the astral body, which must be supposed to be on the left of the picture. A sad travesty of the divine quality love; yet even this is a stage in evolution, and distinctly an improvement upon earlier stages, as will presently be seen.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "99%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/thought-forms/master/assets/images/fig13.jpg" /><hr class="section"></div> </div>
