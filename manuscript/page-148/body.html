This spheroid is hollow, as are all such forms, for it is slowly increasing in sizeâ€”gradually radiating outward from its centre, but growing proportionately less vivid and more ethereal in appearance as it does so, until at last it loses coherence and fades away much as a wreath of smoke might do.
