We have here the first specimen of an interesting class of thought-forms of which we shall find abundant examples laterâ€”that in which light of one colour shines out through a network of lines of some quite different hue. It will be noted that in this case from the mass of violet there rise many wavy lines which flow like rivulets over a golden plain; and this makes it clear that the loftiest aspiration is by no means vague, but is thoroughly supported by an intellectual grasp of the situation and a clear comprehension of the method by which it can be put into effect.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">![FIG. 36.
